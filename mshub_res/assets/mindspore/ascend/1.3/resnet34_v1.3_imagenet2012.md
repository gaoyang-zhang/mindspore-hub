## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of resnet from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at model_zoo/official/cv/resnet.

resnet is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [model_zoo/official/cv/resnet](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.3/model_zoo/official/cv/resnet/README.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.

## Usage

```python
import mindspore
import mindspore_hub as mshub
from mindspore import Tensor
from mindspore import nn
from mindspore import context
from mindspore.train.model import Model
from mindspore.common import dtype as mstype
from mindspore.dataset.transforms import py_transforms

context.set_context(mode=context.GRAPH_MODE,
                    device_target="Ascend",
                    device_id=0)

model = "mindspore/ascend/1.3/resnet34_v1.3_imagenet2012"
# initialize the number of classes based on the pre-trained model
network = mshub.load(model, dataset = "imagenet2012")
network.set_train(False)

# ...
```
