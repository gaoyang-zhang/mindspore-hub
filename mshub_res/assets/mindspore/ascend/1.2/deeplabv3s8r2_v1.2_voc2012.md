## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of deeplabv3 from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at model_zoo/official/cv/deeplabv3.

deeplabv3 is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [model_zoo/official/cv/deeplabv3](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/blob/r1.2/model_zoo/official/cv/deeplabv3/README.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.

## Usage

```python
import mindspore_hub as mshub
from mindspore import context

context.set_context(mode=context.GRAPH_MODE,
                    device_target="Ascend",
                    device_id=0)

model = "mindspore/ascend/1.2/deeplabv3s8r2_v1.2_voc2012"
# initialize the number of classes based on the pre-trained model
network = mshub.load(model, num_classes=21)
network.set_train(False)

# ...
```
