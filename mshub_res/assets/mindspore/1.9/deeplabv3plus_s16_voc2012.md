## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of deeplabv3plus from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at research/cv/deeplabv3plus.

deeplabv3plus is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [research/cv/deeplabv3plus](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/r1.9/research/cv/deeplabv3plus/README_CN.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.

## Usage

```python
import mindspore_hub as mshub
from mindspore import context

context.set_context(mode=context.GRAPH_MODE,
                    device_target="Ascend",
                    device_id=0)

model = "mindspore/1.9/deeplabv3plus_s16_voc2012"
network = mshub.load(model)
network.set_train(False)

# ...
```
