## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of stpm from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at research/cv/stpm.

stpm is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [research/cv/stpm](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/r1.9/research/cv/stpm/README.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.
