## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of ssim-ae from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at official/cv/ssim-ae.

ssim-ae is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [official/cv/ssim-ae](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/r1.9/official/cv/ssim-ae/README_CN.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.
