## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of LearningToSeeInTheDark from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at research/cv/LearningToSeeInTheDark.

LearningToSeeInTheDark is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [research/cv/LearningToSeeInTheDark](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/r1.6/research/cv/LearningToSeeInTheDark/README_CN.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.
