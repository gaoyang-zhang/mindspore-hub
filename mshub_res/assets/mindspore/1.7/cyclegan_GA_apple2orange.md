## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of CycleGAN from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at research/cv/CycleGAN.

CycleGAN is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [research/cv/CycleGAN](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/r1.7/research/cv/CycleGAN/README.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.
