## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of EfficientDet_d0 from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at research/cv/EfficientDet_d0.

EfficientDet_d0 is a cv network. More details please refer to the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at [research/cv/EfficientDet_d0](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/r1.8/research/cv/EfficientDet_d0/README_CN.md).

All parameters in the module are trainable.
