## Introduction

This MindSpore Hub model uses the implementation of IPT from the MindSpore model zoo on Gitee at model_zoo/research/cv/IPT.

## Usage

```python
import mindspore_hub as mshub

from mindspore import context

from src.args import args

context.set_context(mode=context.PYNATIVE_MODE,
                    device_target="GPU",
                    device_id=0)

model = "noah-cvlab/gpu/1.1/ipt_v1.0_Set14_SR_x3"
network = mshub.load(model, args)

network.set_train(False)
```
